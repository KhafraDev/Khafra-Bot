Almost immediately, the State of California sued the Trump administration over the constitutionality of the question. The Constitution states a census, or “actual enumeration,” must take place every 10 years, and the enumeration must include “the number of free persons.” The State of California alleged this would include citizens and non-citizens alike.",

Police drew their guns in the House chamber in an effort to block rioters from entering the room.
